# Collaboration Invitation

Thank you for your interest in the **Predator-Prey Dynamics and Dynamic Carrying Capacity Theorem**! This project is open-source and we welcome contributions from researchers, ecologists, mathematicians, and anyone interested in refining this model and testing it in real-world environments.

### What is this project about?

This theorem extends the traditional Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model by introducing a **dynamic carrying capacity** that fluctuates over time. The goal is to better reflect real-world ecosystems where resource availability and environmental conditions change, which in turn influences the equilibrium populations of both predators and prey.

### How can you contribute?

There are several ways to get involved with this project:

#### 1. **Empirical Data Contribution**
   - **Provide real-world data**: If you have access to ecological data where predator-prey dynamics are well-documented (e.g., marine ecosystems, wildlife reserves), we’d love to incorporate that data to validate and refine the model.
   - **Suggest ecosystems to test**: If you know of specific ecosystems that would be good candidates for model testing, let us know!

#### 2. **Theoretical Improvements**
   - **Mathematical Refinement**: Help improve the mathematical formulation of the model. We encourage input on how we can make the model more accurate, especially when it comes to the **dynamic carrying capacity**.
   - **Propose alternative formulations**: Have you come across a different mathematical approach to predator-prey dynamics that might work better? Share it with us!

#### 3. **Simulation Development**
   - **Develop simulations**: Help us build interactive simulations of the model where users can test different values for **carrying capacity** and observe the impact on **predator** and **prey populations**.
   - **Code Refactoring**: Contribute to the codebase by improving the efficiency of our simulation models or ensuring compatibility across different platforms.

#### 4. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Test the model**: Implement the theorem in various ecosystems (e.g., marine life, forest wildlife) and compare predicted population behaviors with real data. This is essential for ensuring the practical accuracy of the model.
   - **Help design experiments**: Assist in the design of experiments that will allow us to test the validity of the model in field settings.

#### 5. **Documentation and Outreach**
   - **Improve documentation**: Help make the documentation clearer, more concise, or more accessible to a wider audience.
   - **Share this project**: If you’re part of an academic community or ecological organization, we’d love for you to share this project and help build a network of people contributing to it.
   - **Create tutorials**: Help us build guides, tutorials, and videos on how to implement and use this model in real-world scenarios.
