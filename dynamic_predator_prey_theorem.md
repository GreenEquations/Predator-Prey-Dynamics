# ðŸ“˜ Dynamic Predator-Prey Theorem: Fluctuating Carrying Capacity

## I. Theorem Statement

In predator-prey ecosystems, when the environmental carrying capacity becomes time-dependent, the system no longer stabilizes at fixed equilibrium points.

Let:

- K(t): Time-dependent carrying capacity
- P(t): Prey population
- Q(t): Predator population

Then, for a system with non-constant K(t), the equilibrium points become dynamic and shift over time, stabilizing below the traditional fixed carrying capacity.

## II. Model Equations

### Dynamic Carrying Capacity
A sinusoidal carrying capacity:

    K(t) = Kâ‚€ * (1 + Î» * sin(Ï‰t) + Ï† * cos(Ï‰t))

Where:
- Kâ‚€: Baseline carrying capacity
- Î», Ï†: Amplitude parameters
- Ï‰: Frequency of oscillation

### Modified Lotka-Volterra Equations

    dP/dt = Î±P * (1 - P / K(t)) - Î²PQ  
    dQ/dt = Î´PQ - Î³Q

Where:
- Î±: Prey growth rate
- Î²: Predation rate
- Î´: Predator growth rate per consumed prey
- Î³: Predator mortality rate

## III. Equilibrium Behavior

Given K(t) is fluctuating:

- Equilibrium prey population:

      P*(t) = (Î± * K(t)) / (Î² + Î³)

- Equilibrium predator population:

      Q*(t) = (Î´ * Î± * K(t)) / (Î²(Î³ + Î´))

Thus, both P*(t) and Q*(t) become **functions of time** and shift with K(t).

## IV. Predictions

1. Populations stabilize **below** fixed Kâ‚€ in environments with seasonal or fluctuating resources.
2. Oscillations in P and Q match the frequency Ï‰ of the carrying capacity K(t).
3. Empirical populations in dynamic environments match this model more closely than fixed-K models.

## V. Simulation Suggestions

- Simulate using numerical ODE solvers (e.g., Euler, Runge-Kutta)
- Track P(t) and Q(t) over time with sinusoidal K(t)
- Validate against real-world data (e.g., marine or wildlife ecosystems)

## VI. Applications

- **Ecology**: More realistic models of population fluctuation
- **Conservation**: Predicting collapse under environmental stress
- **Systems Biology**: Modeling coupled systems with time-dependent resources
